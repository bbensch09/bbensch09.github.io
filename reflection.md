##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
 I learned that padding is used for the spacing between content of an element (i.e. text) and it's border. The border is the physical line or dotted line that surrounds an element. And the margin is the spacing outside of the element that provides buffer between other elements.
##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
 Overall, I learned that CSS positioning requires a ton of trial and error. Only after I played A LOT with adjusting property types in Chrome Dev Tools and resizing screens / scrolling often, did I really start to understand the distinctions between static, relative, absolute, and fixed.
##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest was simply making color and font size changes. The hardest was spacing by far. In particular, spacing of elements horizontally such that they remained evenly distributed and responsive to screen sizes was very much a headache until I discovered the grid methodology (i.e. col-4, col-6, col-8, etc.)
##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that good CSS requires a well thought out design, and intentional decisions as to whether to use classes or ids or simple tag selectors.
