  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was pretty straight-forward because we were simply replicating a fairly basic site layout. I'm very comfortable with the general structure of an HTML layout and the syntax / core use of the main tags.
  - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    I think that I need to do more research on HTML5. I understand the core value proposition of using more intuitive section, article, nav, header and footer tags instead of just a generic div element, so that they are more human readable. However, I don't quite understand why doing so would actually impact the user experience. I've read a few things that suggest it facilitates automated cateogrization of elements and better supports video and audio files, but I need to dig a bit deeper to really understand how that's achieved and what the core benefits look like.
  - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    I think it was pretty easy to avoid formatting since the prompt showed us an example image of the unformatted page, which was our objective to re-create.
  - What seems good and bad about HTML?
    Good - tags all have very intuitive names; relative to core git commands, there also seems to be far less brute memorization necessary to create a basic HTML page.
    Bad - as I imagine we'll get into later, HTML is only really useful for structuring static content I believe. Ultimately there aren't too many websites where the content is fixed, and hence I'm looking forward to learning how to use the rails framework and javascript to create web apps that will handle dynamic experiences based on user engagement.
  - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    My peer taught me that it's important to translate special characters into their ASCII equivalent, and so I've bookmarked the site http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm in order to convert characters like & and @ in my HTML text.
