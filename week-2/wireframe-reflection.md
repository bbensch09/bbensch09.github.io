##Below is the wireframe for my home page / site index:

##When the user clicks into the blog sections, they will see this my blog/index page, which will look something like this:

---Begin Reflection ---
###What is a wireframe?
  A wireframe is a hand-drawn or digital sketch of the layout of a website. It is meant to be very quick & conceptual but force you to consider the core elements and layout of the page, keepign in mind what you want the user to do or takeaway from the page.
###What are the benefits of wireframing?
  Your are able to very quickly get a visual mockup of the site experience and be able to obtain feedback from all stakeholders about the proposed layout before writing a single line of code. This yields faster iteration and a more efficient design process.
###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  Yes, but I don't know that I was as creative with it as I could be, but also acknowledge that visual creativity is not my strong suite. I decided to use Gliffy since it was free, and I enjoyed that they had some template wireframes that I was able to build off of.
###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  I mostly stuck with my first idea.
###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  I didn't have any pressing questions. I think most of all was the realization that I haven't generally noticed the design of a webpage unless or until it is problematic, and so I didn't really have in my head a concept of all of the different common types of site layouts that I'm used to seeing. I did install the Wirify bookmarklet, which I thought was kind of neat, and I looked at a few of my favorite sites as Wirify wireframes, which served as good inspiration.
###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  In general I enjoyed the beginner's guide article. I found it I guess a little tedious to not be given a recommended wireframing tool, and so I probably wasted too much time playing with a bunch of them. If I utlimately decide to be a web designer (unlikely), then I'll clearly want to evaluate the different offerings, but really for the sake of DBC and my next entrepreneurial persuit, something simple like Gliffy is probably fine, though after I started using it realized it's also on a free trial basis.
