#Below should be the image file of my site map.
Notes to self:
 - MUST include current directory folder name in the relative path
 i.e. /week-2/imgs/site-map.png
 - unless the image file is in the same folder as the .md file. if that's the case, then just use filename.
 - Note: 
 /imgs/site-map.png DOESN"T WORK


![site map image](/week-2/imgs/site-map.png "Brians sitemap")
