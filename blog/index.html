            <h1> What is Rails? A brief intro to Ruby on Rails </h1>
            <h2>November 22nd, 2015</h2>
            <p>
              As we wrap up the remote Phase 0 stage of Dev Bootcamp, we'll soon begin the onsite immersion program where we will spend significant time using the web application framework known as Ruby on Rails, or more simply, Rails. Rails is an open-source web application framework originally designed by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004. What exactly is a web application framework? For starters, we must consider what a web application is.

            <h2>November 14th, 2015</h2>
            <p> This week in Dev Bootcamp was our 3rd week diving deeper and deeper into Ruby. In today’s post, I’m going to attempt to explain the concept of classes, and why they are incredibly useful in any object-oriented programming language (i.e. pretty much all modern programming languages).

            <h2>October 28th, 2015</h2>
            <p> In this week’s DevBootcamp content, we explored more complex methods in Ruby, solving some fun challenges including how to create dice with infinite sides, how to calculate the mode, and so much more! We also began (without realizing it) to use a certain types of methods called enumerable methods. What exactly is an enumerable method?

            <h2>October 14th, 2015</h2>
              <p> The past two weeks at Dev Bootcamp Phase 0, we've been focusing on the core nuts and bults of web development - HMTL and CSS. Everyone has heard of HTML (even my mother). CSS is somewhat less universally understood, but is arguably more important and far more powerful than HTML. While HTML is where the content (core text, images, and structure) of a website is built, CSS determines how that content actually looks to the user. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and will be the topic of today's blog post....  </p>
