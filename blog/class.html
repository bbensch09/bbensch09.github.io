          This week in Dev Bootcamp was our 3rd week diving deeper and deeper into Ruby. In today’s post, I’m going to attempt to explain the concept of classes, and why they are incredibly useful in any object-oriented programming language (i.e. pretty much all modern programming languages).
        </p>
        <p>
          So what exactly is a class? A class is basically a blueprint from which individual objects are created. In real-world terms, we might consider class to be a representation of identity. All humans have two legs, two hands, and walk upright. These characteristics could be used to define the class of objects known as Human, and that you and I are each instances of that class.
        </p>
        <p>
          A given object can have more than one class, because classes can be inherited in a fairly logical manner. Men could be defined as a child class of Human, since all men are humans, but clearly they have some distinct features that not all humans share. Likewise, Mammals could be the parent class of Human, since all humans are mammals. Let us now look at some example code to see how we might construct and use a class called Human.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let’s determine the attributes and actions we want all objects of the class Human to have. For simplicity, we’ll say that all humans have a name, an age, a height, and a birthday.
        </p>
<pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
class Human
    attr_accessor :name, :age, :gender, :height, :birthday

    def initialize (name,age,gender,height,birthday)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @gender = gender
    @height = height
    @birthday = birthday
    end

    def name
        puts "My name is #{@name}."
    end

    def intelligence
    puts "Humans can learn anything!"
    end

    def interests
    puts "I love Ruby, HTML, and CSS!"
    end

    def chromosomes
    puts "I have 23 chromosomes."
    end

  end
</code> </pre>

<p> Now that we’ve defined what it means to be Human using this class, we can create instances of Human outside of the class by simply initializing new instances of Human, and passing through the actual values we want to use to describe our humans. In the code below, we create two objects called adam and eve, each of which is an instance of the class Human.
</p>

<pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
    adam = Human.new("Adam",25,'male',180,'January 1st')
    eve = Human.new('Eve',25,'female',170,'January 1st')
</pre> </code>

<p> Even though we’ve literally only written one line of code about adam, we can now call a variety of methods about Adam, since Adam automatically inherits all of the methods of the human class.
</p>

<pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
    adam.name
    eve.name
    adam.intelligence
    adam.interests
    eve.chromosomes

    :>  My name is Adam.
        My name is Eve.
        Humans can learn anything!
        I love Ruby, HTML, and CSS!
        I have 23 chromosomes.

</code> </pre>

      <p>
        As you can see, because we went through the effort of creating the class structure, the rest of our code becames far more lightweight and effortless. In a nutshell, that hopefully gives you a foundational understanding of how classes work in Ruby. Have questions or comments?
