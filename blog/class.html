          In this weekâ€™s DevBootcamp content, we explored more complex methods in Ruby, solving some fun challenges including how to create dice with infinite sides, how to calculate the mode, and so much more! We also began (without realizing it) to use a certain types of methods called enumerable methods. What exactly is an enumerable method?
        </p>
        <p> An "enumerable" is basically a collection of methods that are packaged together so that they can be mixed in with other methods that belong to a class. Also known as a "mixin", enumerable methods allow Ruby developers to bypass re-writing a bunch of new code when they want to create a new method within a class. Most of the popular and commonly used enumerables make use of the #each method (which is itself an enumerable that enables iteration), and allow you to iterate through a hash or array without having to explicitly call the #each method directly.
        </p>
        <p> For example, let's dive into the #map enumerable method for the remainder of this blog post. When #map is called on an array or hash, it is implicitly going to apply the each method for iteration, and allows you to define a set of modifications to make to each element or key-value pair in your array or hash. The example below takes a simple array of the numbers 1 thru 5, and <em> modifies </em> them by adding 10 to each element.
        </p>
<pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
  array = [1,2,3,4,5]
  array.map{|x| x + 10}
= > [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
</code> </pre>
        <p> This may look very similar to the type of result we'd expect to see when calling #each. The core difference is that #map is actually modifying the elements in their existing structure, and returning that structure non-destructively. If we ran the exact same code with #each, we would simply get our original array back. Each doesn't modify our array, it simply allows us to execute a block of code using the elements. If we ran the code but included a #puts call in our block, then we'd get the resulting elements printed out. Note that in both cases, the original structure of the object is maintained.
        </p>
<pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
arr.each{|x| x+10}
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#nothing happens

arr.each{|x| puts x+10}
11
12
13
14
15
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  </code> </pre>
      <p> The #map enumerable can also be used to evaluate each element and return the result of your evaluation, as a boolean or conditional assignment. For example, we can use #map to determine which elements are divisible by 3, 5, or both. You may have heard of a childhood (or adult drinking) game called "bizz, buzz". If only you had a better grasp of Ruby at the time you could have made yourself a nice little cheat sheet!
      </p>
      <pre> <code class="ruby" style="font-size:1.2em">
array=(1..20).map do |x|
  if x % 3 ==0 && x % 5 ==0
     'bizz-buzz'
   elsif x % 3 == 0
     'bizz'
   elsif x % 5 == 0
     'buzz'
   else x
  end
end
=> [1, 2, "bizz", 4, "buzz", "bizz", 7, 8, "bizz", "buzz", 11, "bizz", 13, 14, "bizz-buzz", 16, 17, "bizz", 19, "buzz"]
  </code> </pre>

      <p>
        In a nutshell, that hopefully gives you a foundational understanding of enumerable methods. Have questions or comments? If so, checkout out my GitHub and please leave your feedback there <a href="https://github.com/bbensch09/bbensch09.github.io/tree/master/blog"> GitHub </a> or Canvas!
