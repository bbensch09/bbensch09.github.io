      Welcome to my first blog post! For those who aren't familiar, I recently decided to quit my job at a great company called Metromile, and am leaving behind corporate comforts of established / VC-backed tech companies to pursuse my own dream of running my own business. After 6 years becoming a paid search and display expert (first at Google and then as a growth analyst at Metromile), I'm leaving behind the world of keywords, target ROAS bids, and attribution models, and for those who know me well, you know that my heart was never really into explaining why DFSA bidding on PLAs could dramatically lower the CPA and improve ROI by a bagillion percent. I've now left those acronymns behind, and in exchange am learning a whole new world of command-line syntax to be typed into what I will probably always think of as "the matrix."

    <p> <img src="../imgs/island_foxes.jpg" align="right" height=250px> I will be updating this blog once a week as part of my assignments, usually with a combination of focused and unfocused reflections from the previous week.  This was the first week of a 19-week journey that I've begun with my fellow Island Foxes, and am looking forward to the next 18!
    <p> For this first week, my DBC instructor has prompted us to consider the three questions below while introducing the concept of version control to beginner developers. I hope you enjoy.
      <ul>
        <li>What are the benefits of version control? </li>
        <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</li>
        <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
       What are the benefits of version control? For starters, we should probably define what is version control. I'm going to do so with an analogy that assumes the majority of readers of this blog are either fellow DBC folks, or friends of mine who grew up using the web as teenagers, and are explicitly not my mother, who couldn't begin to describe what it means for something to live in the "cloud". Anyone who used computers for school or work prior to 2010 probably remembers a group email thread with an attached file named - TeamPowerpoint_version_12a.ppt. Core spreadsheets and word processing documents  historically never had real systems for version control, meaning in order to keep track of different drafts, we had to repeatedly rename files with new names, and end up with 10+ different files for one team project. What happened if a teammate forgot to change the file name and you then had TWO versions of TeamPowerpoint_version11 floating around? Chaos. Or even outside group projects, what if you decided you really like that introductory quote 3 hours after deleting it? You probably just held down Ctrl+Z for about 10minutes... Version control fixes these problems.
<p>
        Version control is a systematic approach to managing the different versions of a project, so that the evolution of a project is easily trackable and revertable, no matter how many files or collaborators are involved. Due to the inevitable nature of "bugs" in software, version control is far more crucial than it is for word processing, because without it, searching for the one line of code amongst thousands of files is like searching for a needle in a haystack.
    </p>
    <p> How does version control work? The most common system developers today use to manage version control is by using a program called git, which interfaces with the popular website GitHub, to remotely host millions of developers' projects. More to come later, but git and GitHub are very much NOT the same thing. Git it is a software program that runs locally on your computer, whereas GitHub is basically a central hub of coding projects that millions of users have used to store their code in a publically accessible website. Most commonly, we use the git program to send our files into GitHub. So how does it all work?
<p>
    First, a central principle of version control is that for any given project, there should always be one "master" branch of the project. The master branch considered is always bug-free (or at least the most bug-free) and considered the most perfect version. In order to assure that it remains the best version, a universal best practice is that collaborators should never make changes to the master branch directly. Similarly, its is a nearly universal best practice to store the master branch in the cloud (i.e. on the web), usually by storing it on GitHub. If the master version wasn't stored online (i.e. if it just sat on my local hard drive), collaborators would have to email me and ask me to send it to them before they could begin working on their contributions. With the master branch stored in GitHub, there is always one source of truth that all collaborators can access and know that they have the most up to date version. Note that GitHub is not the only place you can store your master branch. Within corporations, it is common to have a private cloud-based hub similar to GitHub which serves the same function, but for the sake of protecting their proprietary code, it is only accessible by company employees. When a developer wants to do work to improve the project, they start by making a clone of the master branch on their local computers. This clone is generally considered a "feature branch", and the developer can make any changes they want, knowing that they won't accidentally ruin master if they save a draft of their work. While working on the feature branch, the developer can save their work in as many smaller chunks as they want, and we call those chunks "commits". Each commit contains a short messaging summarizing the changes that were made, to facilitate the rest of the team understanding what types of changes were made when during a code review, without having to read every single line of code. When the developer's work on the feature branch is finished, they propose a merger of their feature branch to the master branch. They do this by pushing their local feature-branch into GitHub and creating a pull request, which prompts their teammates to review the proposed changes and give their approval before the merge into master can be made. Finally, as an extra fail safe, if an undetected a bug appears after the merge, GitHub systematically stores and tracks every commit and merge, so it takes only a few clicks to revert back to the previous version.

       While long-winded, that is my attempat at a brief introduction to version control. If you have questions or comments, please by all means share them below. Slash don't share them below yet, since I haven't figured out how to enable comments...(stay tuned, maybe next week!)
