How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  - I found it pretty easy and enjoyable to create the wireframe and basic HTML page with my pair. Jon was easy to work with, and we didn't really have many disagreements, and both helped each other out with syntax a few times.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  - Definitely. It was far easy to go from visual image to writing the HTML tags, than trying to do it from scratch with a vague concept of the structure in your head.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  - We decided that the wireframe should have all of the core elements a user would expect to see on a blog post page (titles, blog text with images, a nav bar, etc.) and to not worry too much about any color schemes or actual button text.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  - I didn't learn any new elements. Though we did discuss how best to use our hiearchy of h1/h2/h3/etc. tags within HTML5, and that discussion clarified my understanding of the purpose of HTML5, but am still a bit unclear about whether or not we should be reusing <h1>'s in a different <section> tag, for example.
